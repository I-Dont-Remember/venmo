# Recurring & Scheduled Venmo

Inspired by [Joe Previte's recurring Venmo script](https://joeprevite.com/send-automatic-recurring-payments-on-venmo), I wanted my own.
Venmo deprecated new sign ups with access tokens through the `Settings->Developer` page of the account, but the handy dandy library from [mmohades](https://github.com/mmohades/Venmo) still has the ability to login and get credentials to access as of 06/2021.

Trying to keep things simple to start, but would like to expand it and make it much easier to use. Spreading this widely might be against the wishes of Venmo, will have to be not dumb with it.
